**Bubbly Sort Visualizer**
Welcome to the Bubbly Sort Visualizer! ðŸŽ‰ This project offers an engaging and interactive visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm, showcasing how this fundamental sorting method works through animated bar representations.
**Features:**
Interactive Visualization: Observe the sorting process as elements are compared and swapped, demonstrating the "bubbling" effect.
Step-by-Step Execution: Experience each phase of the algorithm in detail, making it easy to understand how Bubble Sort organizes data.
Predefined Bar Representation: The visualization uses a fixed set of numbers displayed as bars, allowing users to see how different values interact during the sorting process.
Educational Tool: Perfect for students and anyone interested in learning about sorting algorithms in a clear and visual manner.
